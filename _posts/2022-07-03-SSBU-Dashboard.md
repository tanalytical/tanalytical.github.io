# SSBU Dashboard 

https://sbudata.shinyapps.io/sbudata/app.html

There are so many match ups in Super Smash Bros Ultimate and many strong opinions on which characters are favorable over others. Although theory crafting is an essential part of deciding which character has the advantage over another; I wondered if these theories were supported by overall performance in recorded games. I created this dashboard using smashdata.gg's API that includes over 7 million recorded games. Aggregate data is used to run this dashboard. Click any two characters and see how they perform against each other! Note: There is a large mix of skill levels included in the dataset that are not accounted for. This can be further explored in future analysis.
